## Overview

Skin cancer can be deadly if not caught early, but many populations lack specialized dermatologic care. Over the past several years, dermoscopy-based AI algorithms have been shown to benefit clinicians in diagnosing melanoma, basal cell, and squamous cell carcinoma. However, determining which individuals should see a clinician in the first place has great potential impact. Triaging applications have a significant potential to benefit underserved populations and improve early skin cancer detection, the key factor in long-term patient outcomes.

### Description

This project is about developing image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP). The image quality resembles close-up smartphone photos, which are regularly submitted for telehealth purposes.

This project is part of the ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of diagnostically labelled images with additional metadata. The images are JPEGs. The associated .csv file contains a binary diagnostic label (target), potential input variables (e.g. age_approx, sex, anatom_site_general, etc.), and additional attributes (e.g. image source and precise diagnosis).

The datasets contains 15mm-by-15mm field-of-view cropped images, centered on distinct lesions, that were extracted from 3D total body photographs. The official training dataset for the challenge is the SLICE-3D Dataset: 400,000 skin lesion image crops extracted from 3D TBP for skin cancer detection. The official testing dataset contain tiles from a separate set of patients.

Datasets were curated by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) from images contributed from the following sources:

- Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (USA)
- Hospital Clinic de Barcelona (Spain)
- The University of Queensland (Australia)
- Medical University of Vienna (Austria)
- University of Athens (Greece)
- Melanoma Institute Australia (Australia)
- University Hospital of Basel (Switzerland)
- Alfred Hospital (Australia)
- FNQH Cairns (Australia)
